# Introduction to Data Mining

## What is Data Mining?

Data mining is the process of **discovering patterns**, correlations, and **anomalies** within large datasets to predict outcomes. By utilizing a combination of **statistics**, **machine learning**, and **database systems**, data mining transforms raw data into meaningful information. The primary goal is to extract valuable insights from data to aid in decision-making and strategic planning.

$$
\begin{equation}
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
\end{equation}
$$



## Difference Between Data Mining and Data Science

While data mining focuses on extracting patterns and knowledge from large datasets, data science is a broader field that encompasses various techniques and tools for analyzing and interpreting complex data. Data science integrates principles from mathematics, statistics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge to understand and solve real-world problems.

In summary:
- **Data Mining**: A specialized process aimed at finding patterns and insights within data.
- **Data Science**: An interdisciplinary field that uses data for comprehensive analysis, including data mining, but also involving data cleaning, preparation, and advanced modeling.
